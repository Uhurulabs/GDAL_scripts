# GDAL_scripts
Various utility scripts/snippets for managing geographical data

# What's in here?

These are basically snippets to accomplish various useful and/or interesting tasks. They are in Bash script format since my colleagues and I primarily use a GNU/Linux environment where scripts are a natural way to organize our work. However, almost all of what's here can be effectively used to copy-paste into any other environment where GDAL is running.

Contributions welcome; we'll accept pretty much any working, on-topic pull request that doesn't actually break what we've done.

This work is part of the Ramani Huria project, funded by the World Bank and executed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.
